"#0Talk-1st time","3000000","Oh, thou'rt unkindled, and a seeker of Lords."
"#0Talk-1st time","3000001","I am Ludleth of Courland."
"#0Talk-1st time","3000002","Look not in bewilderment as I say...
I linked the fire long ago, becoming a Lord of Cinder."
"#0Talk-1st time","3000003","If substantiation be thy want,
set thine eyes upon my charred corse."
"#0Talk-1st time","3000004","This sad cadav'r.
No need to be coy, have a closer look."
"#0Talk-2nd time","3000100","Fret not, fret not, my feet are here firmly planted."
"#0Talk-2nd time","3000101","For I am a Lord, and this is my throne."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000700","Knowest thou of our purpose?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000701","Five thrones will take five Lords,
as kindling for the linking of the fire."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000702","The fast-fading flame must be linked, to preserve this world."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000703","A re-enactment of the first linking of the fire."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000704","So it is I became a Lord of Cinder."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","3000705","I may be but small, but I will die a colossus."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000801","Before I was a Lord of Cinder, I was a student of transposition."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000802","The process of extracting, and coalescing, the essence of a soul."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000803","A forbidden art, that once left a foul stain upon Courland's honour."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000804","Tis an art that grants powers once thought unattainable."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000805","Most transposing kilns were lost with Courland,
but this place is a crossing for all manner of cursed objects."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after entering the Undead Settlement","3000806","If thou happen'st 'pon a transposing kiln, bring it to me, quick."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after the protagonist defeats their 1st Lord of Cinder","3000900","Ahh, most illustrious Lordseeker.
Or should I say, Lord-slayer?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after the protagonist defeats their 1st Lord of Cinder","3000901","Fine kindling for the thrones,
is it not, each soul truly worthy of Lordship."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after the protagonist defeats their 1st Lord of Cinder","3000902","And all slain by thy hand.
To bind them to their thrones, even in death."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after the protagonist defeats their 1st Lord of Cinder","3000903","Oh, I have no qualms.
For as we are to our thrones, thou art to thy duty."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after the protagonist defeats their 1st Lord of Cinder","3000904","In fact, methinks thou'st helped
these poor Lords along their rightful path."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001000","Oh, belike it is...a transposing kiln in thy possession."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001001","Seen better days, but, methinks it shall suffice."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001002","Now, bring to me a twisted soul."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001003","Transposition is the art of extracting,
and coalescing, the essence of a soul."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001004","In transposing a twisted soul,
its true power transferreth to thee."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Transposing Kiln","3001005","Thy purpose is to seek Lords, and slay them.
What's to fear in a little transposition, now?"
"#0Talk-After giving him the Transposing Kiln","3000300","Ah-hah, thou'rt returned. And a fine day it is."
"#0Talk-After giving him the Transposing Kiln","3000301","So, happened upon any twisted souls?"

"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" with ""Lothric's Holy Sword"" & ""Lorian's Greatsword""","3002301","A curse once bound them together, such that they served as one."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" with ""Lothric's Holy Sword"" & ""Lorian's Greatsword""","3002302","A transposing kiln should restore their rightful form."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" with ""Lothric's Holy Sword"" & ""Lorian's Greatsword""","3002303","But before thou should'st act, think well upon the matter."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" with ""Lothric's Holy Sword"" & ""Lorian's Greatsword""","3002304","As thou knowest, they are but newly rent apart."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave","3000600","Now, now, do not be away overlong."
"#0Talk-After acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3001500","Ahh, found her, did we?"

"#0Talk-After acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3001505","Mayhap I should apprise thee..."
"#0Talk-After acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3001506","Of what the thin light of these eyes might reveal,
to the eyeless Fire Keeper."
"#0Talk-After acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3001507","Scenes of betrayal,
things never intended for her ken, visions of..."
"#0Talk-After acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3001508","...this age's end..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002200","The eyes shew a world destitute of fire,
a barren plane of endless darkness."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002201","A place born of betrayal."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002202","So I will'd myself Lord, to link the fire,
to paint a new vision."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after acquiring the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002203","What is thine intent?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after giving the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002000","I took the mantle of Lord of Cinder of mine own volition.
I speak these words with pride."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after giving the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002001","Choose thy fate alone. Seize it with thine own hands."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after giving the Eyes of a Fire Keeper","3002002","All the more, should thy fate entail such foul betrayal..."

"#0Talk-After helping Anri defeat Aldrich","3001704","Though gave no elucidation..."
"#0Talk-After helping Anri defeat Aldrich","3001705","So. Happened upon any twisted souls?"
"#00Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after helping Anri defeat Aldrich","3002100","Now, heed this little warning, from this little lord."
"#00Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after helping Anri defeat Aldrich","3002101","Seek not the girl."
"#00Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave after helping Anri defeat Aldrich","3002102","Seek not the boy."
