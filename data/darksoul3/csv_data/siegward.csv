"#0Talk-1st time","21000101","Mmmmmm..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000200","Hmm... Mmm..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000201","Oh!"
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000202","Pardon me. I was absorbed in thought."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000203","I am Siegward of Catarina."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000204","To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000205","Have you ever walked near a white birch,
only to be struck by a great arrow?"
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000206","Well, if I'm not mistaken, they come from this tower."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000207","Whoever it is, I'm sure I can talk some sense into them."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000208","But I have to find a way up, and that's just the trouble."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000209","This lift only goes down, you see, and..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000210","Well, that doesn't get me anywhere..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21000211","Hmm... Mmm..."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21000300","This lift only goes down, but you know..."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21000301","With a little warming up, eventually... No, no..."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21000302","I've got to use my head. And think."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21000303","Hmm... Mmm..."
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000400","Hmm... Mmm..."
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000401","Ah, oh!"
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000402","Don't disappear like that. You had me downright worried."
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000403","But thanks to you, an epiphany has struck me square in the head."
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000404","I've unravelled the riddle of this inscrutable lift!"
"#0Talk-1st time after using elevator","21000405","..."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000500","On some days, I begin to doubt myself."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000501","I went up the tower, so I thought, then somehow ended up here."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000502","I'm not exactly sure what happened."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000503","Anyhow, do you see that? That humungous beast."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000504","I'm no coward, and I've a steady hand,
but that thing makes my skin crawl."
"#0Talk-2nd time after using elevator","21000505","Now, now, think twice before you go down that road."
"#0Talk-3rd time after using elevator","21000600","I could try talking some sense into him..."
"#0Talk-3rd time after using elevator","21000601","No, I think not. He's far too over-heated."
"#0Talk-3rd time after using elevator","21000602","I've got to use my head. And think."
"#0Talk-3rd time after using elevator","21000603","Hmm... Mmm..."
"#0After attacking the Demon","21000700","No! You should have waited!"
"#0After attacking the Demon","21000701","Well, it's too late now."
"#0After attacking the Demon","21000702","I, Siegward of the Knights of Catarina, fight by your side!"
"#0After attacking the Demon","21000703","..."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000800","..."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000801","That was quite the performance."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000802","But you mustn't get in over your head."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000803","We Unkindled must put our duties first."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000804","But for the moment, we've a toast to make."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000805","To your valour, my sword, and our victory together."
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000806","Long may the sun shine!"
"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Demon","21000807","..."
"#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Demon","21000900","Well, I'm going to have myself a little nap."
"#0Talk-2nd time after defeating the Demon","21000901","The only thing to do, really, after a nice toast."

"#0Talk-1st time","21001200","Oh!"
"#0Talk-1st time","21001201","I know that voice. Just how long has it been!"
"#0Talk-1st time","21001202","It's me, Siegward of Catarina."
"#0Talk-1st time","21001203","I'm loathe to admit it, but I've been had."
"#0Talk-1st time","21001204","Someone's swiped my armour."
"#0Talk-1st time","21001205","Did you happen to see it anywhere?"
"#0Choose ""Haven't seen it"" to the query","21001500","Oh, yes, I see..."
"#0Choose ""Haven't seen it"" to the query","21001501","Not to worry. Great planning begets great fortune."

"#0Talk-2nd time","21001805","Oh, I seemed to have missed my chance, so..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21001806","I, Siegward of Catarina, offer my deepest gratitude."
"#0Talk-2nd time","21001807","And a little surprise to go with it. It's all yours."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21001900","I know. Won't you join me for dinner?"
"#0Talk-3rd time","21001901","I make a fine estus soup.
I've got some stewing right now."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21001902","Even we Undead deserve a little normalcy, from time to time."
"#0Talk-3rd time","21001903","And finally, upon this rendezvous, let us make a toast."

"#0Talk-4th time","21002000","Have you heard?"
"#0Talk-4th time","21002001","Somewhere, hidden right here in Irithyll, is a deep dungeon."
"#0Talk-4th time","21002002","And even below that, the Profaned Capital."
"#0Talk-4th time","21002003","Home of Yhorm, the reclusive giant lord."
"#0Talk-4th time","21002004","That reminds me, I've a grave promise to keep..."
"#0Talk-5th time","21002100","Oh, sorry, I'm afraid I've cast a cloud over things."
