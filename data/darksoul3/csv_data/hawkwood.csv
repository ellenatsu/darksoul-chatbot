"#0Talk-1st time","7000000","Ahhh, another one, roused from the sleep of death?"
"#0Talk-1st time","7000001","Well, you're not alone. We Unkindled are worthless.
Can't even die right."
"#0Talk-1st time","7000002","Gives me conniptions."
"#0Talk-1st time","7000003","And they'd have us seek the Lords of Cinder,
and return them to their moulding thrones."
"#0Talk-1st time","7000004","But we're talking true legends with the mettle to link the fire.
We're not fit to lick their boots."
"#0Talk-1st time","7000005","Don't you think?"
"#0Talk-1st time","7000006","..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","7000100","What a sick joke."

"#0Talk-1st time after raising the Small Lothric Banner","7000204","A right and proper cleric,
only, he developed a habit of devouring men."
"#0Talk-1st time after raising the Small Lothric Banner","7000205","He ate so many that he bloated like a drowned pig,
then softened into sludge,
so they stuck him in the Cathedral of the Deep."
"#0Talk-1st time after raising the Small Lothric Banner","7000206","And they made him a Lord of Cinder.
Not for virtue, but for might."
"#0Talk-1st time after raising the Small Lothric Banner","7000207","Such is a lord, I suppose.
But here I ask. Do we have a sodding chance?"

You should see where it leads."

"#0Talk-1st time after defeating the Curse-rotted Greatwood or Crystal Sage","7000403","A medallion to gain entry to the keep
of the Undead Legion of Farron,
Lords of Cinder in their own right."
