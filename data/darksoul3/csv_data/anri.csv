Unkindled, like you."
"#0Talk-1st time","19010001","I'm Anri of Astora.
Unkindled, like you."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000002","This is Horace. A friend and travelling companion."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000003","Are you too in search of the Lords of Cinder?"
"#0Talk-1st time","19000004","We are well along the road of sacrifices.
Below us is the Crucifixion Woods."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000005","Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep,
home of the Undead Legion.
Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000006","We seek the cathedral,
home of the grim Aldrich."
"#0Talk-1st time","19010006","We seek the cathedral,
home of the grim Aldrich."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000007","We may go our separate ways now,
but we are both seekers of lords."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000008","The next time we cross paths,
one may find the other in a time of need."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000009","May the flames guide your way."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000100","Oh, yes, Horace..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000101","He's not very talkative."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000102","But don't think ill of him. He's an upstanding,
kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19010102","But don't think ill of him. He is an upstanding,
kind-hearted knight, a fine partner for this gruelling journey."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000103","Without his help, I would have cursed this onerous duty long ago."
"#0Talk-3rd time","19000200","We are well along the road of sacrifices.
Below us is the Crucifixion Woods."
"#0Talk-3rd time","19000201","Beyond the flooded woods lies Farron Keep,

Further yet is the Cathedral of the Deep."
"#0Talk-3rd time","19000202","We may go our separate ways now,
but we are both seekers of lords."
"#0Talk-3rd time","19000203","The next time we cross paths,
one may find the other in a time of need."
"#0Talk-3rd time","19000204","May the flames guide your way."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000300","Oh, and we meet again."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000301","We spoke before on the road of sacrifices. Anri of Astora."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000302","I am well pleased to see you safe."
"#0Talk-1st time","19010302","I am well pleased to see you safe."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000303","We reached the Cathedral of the Deep,
but Aldrich's coffin was empty."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000304","The man-eater must have left for his true home."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000305","The little doll in the empty coffin told me."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000306","Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley,
an ancient fabled city..."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000307","A pilgrim told me that the city
lies beyond Farron Keep."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000308","And so becomes our destination..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000400","Aldrich's honest home is Irithyll in the Boreal Valley,
an ancient fabled city..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000401","A pilgrim told me that the city
lies beyond Farron Keep."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19000402","And so becomes our destination..."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000500","Oh, hello, how very fortunate."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000501","Have you seen my companion, Horace?"
"#0Talk-1st time","19000502","To my shame, I was snared by a trap, and we've become separated."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000503","I've not been able to find him since."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000600","Yes, I see."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000601","Horace is a valiant knight. He can look after himself, no question."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000602","He's probably searching for me right now, with twice the resolve."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000603","If you happen upon him, please tell him."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000604","That I remain in the catacombs..."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000605","And will lay prism stones to guide him, as always."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19000606","Please send him my word, I beg of you."
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 1st query","19010606","Please send him word, I beg of you."

"#0Talk-After choosing ""No"" to the 1st query","19000704","May the flames guide your way."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000800","Ah, hello, we meet again."
"#0Talk-1st time","19000801","Have you seen Horace anywhere?"
"#0Talk-2nd time after choosing ""No"" to the 2nd query","19001100","Oh, yes, I see..."
"#0Talk-2nd time after choosing ""No"" to the 2nd query","19001101","I've searched high and low, with no luck.
Perhaps he's left the catacombs."
"#0Talk-2nd time after choosing ""No"" to the 2nd query","19001102","Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?"
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 2nd query, or choosing ""Say nothing"" to the 3rd query","19001200","Oh, Horace. Where have you run off to?"
"#0Choose ""No"" to the 2nd query, or choosing ""Say nothing"" to the 3rd query","19001201","Have you abandoned me?
No, what a horrible thought..."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000900","Goodness me."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000901","To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19010901","To think there'd be a lake so deep within these catacombs."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000902","What a relief.
I knew that Horace was alive, and wouldn't stray far."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000903","Thank you. We are both in your debt."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000904","This hardly expresses my gratitude,
but it'll have to do for now."
"#0Choose ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19000905","Please, take it.
And may the flames guide your way."
"#0Talk-After choosing ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19001000","I will soon head to the lake."
"#0Talk-After choosing ""Tell of the Smouldering Lake"" to the 2nd or 3rd query","19001001","Thank you. We are both in your debt."

"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001300","Oh, I thought it might be you. Good to see you."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001301","I never managed to find Horace."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001302","But my duty must be done, even alone.
As an unkindled Lordseeker."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001303","For the children I knew,
bless their souls."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001304","We all have our reasons, don't we?"
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001305","Please, take this.
Recompense for my foolish request."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19001306","And also a token of protection.
May the flames guide your way."
"#0Talk-1st time after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19011306","And also a token of protection.

"#0Talk-2nd time","19001401","I would do well to learn from you."
"#0Talk-2nd time","19001402","May the flames guide your way."

"#0Summoned to fight Aldrich after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19012000","Mmm, I thought it might be you."
"#0Summoned to fight Aldrich after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19002001","Then I'm afraid Horace..."
"#0Summoned to fight Aldrich after choosing ""No"" or ""Say nothing""","19002002","...No, this only bolsters my resolve."
