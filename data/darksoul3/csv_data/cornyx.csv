"#0Talk-1st time if chosen the Pyromancer class","14002201","Well then, care to learn some pyromancies from this old man?"
"#0Choose ""Decline"" to the 1st query","14000200","..."
"#0Choose ""Decline"" to the 1st query","14000201","Most foolish.
This old crow has a little knowledge of his own, you know."
"#0Choose ""Decline"" to the 1st query","14000202","Bah. No sense in spelling it out."
"#0Choose ""Decline"" to the 1st query","14000203","I will not rush you. You will return, once you are enlightened."
"#0Choose ""Decline"" to the 1st query","14000204","We are, after all, both Undead.
And both prisoners, in our own ways."

"#0Talk-1st time","14000600","Ahh, there you are, Unkindled One."
"#0Talk-1st time","14000601","I wish to express my gratitude."
"#0Talk-1st time","14000602","For trusting a lowly pyromancer,
and allowing me to gaze upon this majestic flame."
"#0Talk-1st time","14000603","As promised, I will impart pyromancies to you."

Respect your elders, and so on."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time before giving him a Pyromancy Tome","14000902","And pyromancy, of course, is no exception."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time before giving him a Pyromancy Tome","14001000","Oh, we'll need a pyromancy tome
to learn more advanced pyromancies."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time before giving him a Pyromancy Tome","14001001","Though unorthodox,
that would be the most expedient way to make progress."

we could have trained you the hard way."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001701","By the gods. This inscription reads Quelana,
the ancient deity, one of the witches of Izalith..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001702","The last of them, who wandered the lands.
Then she must have returned to Izalith, after all."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001703","But I regret to say, I cannot accept this."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001704","Quelana's pyromancies are for witches,
and must be learned from a mistress."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001705","But thank you, for allowing me to peer upon such a thing."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Quelana Pyromancy Tome""","14001706","If only I were a woman."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome""","14001801","This pyromancy tome is dark, and delves into the depths of men,
where an untouchable flame resides."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome""","14001802","I cannot comprehend this myself,
let alone teach it to you."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome""","14001803","It is a spell forbidden in the Great Swamp,
and nearly everywhere else, too."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Pyromancy Tome"" & ""Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome""","14001804","Only one terribly afflicted, or burdened by deep sorrow,
could begin to understand this."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001100","If you seek pyromancy tomes, take this sage advice."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001101","The lands of the Lords converge upon Lothric."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001102","The home of pyromancies drifts comparatively close, as well."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001103","At least, that is what pyromancers of the Great Swamp believe."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001104","The place is called Izalith.
Oh, how I wish to behold a primal pyromancy."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Great Swamp Pyromancy Tome","14001105","Well, these are old tales.
No one knows where the truth begins, or ends."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Carthus Pyromancy Tome","14001200","Ahh, you found this tome in the Catacombs..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Carthus Pyromancy Tome","14001201","This spell is akin to chaos."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Carthus Pyromancy Tome","14001202","It may even serve as a link to Izalith, home of pyromancies..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome","14001300","Heed my words, Unkindled One."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome","14001301","Fear the fire."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome","14001302","The home of pyromancy, Izalith,
was scorched by the very fire it created."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome","14001303","Undoubtedly, it was a flame of chaos, tangled by a witch's hand."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" after giving him the Izalith Pyromancy Tome","14001304","But who's to say that this Bonfire's flame is any different?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"" or after leaving abruptly","14000800","Do not be gone for long."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"" or after leaving abruptly","14000801","What is a teacher without a pupil?"

"#0Upon being attacked-1st time","14001903","Why? What's the matter?"
"#0Upon being attacked-2nd time","14001904","Stop this, stop this at once!"
"#0Upon being attacked & made hostile","14002000","Fine, fine, I see how it is."
"#0Upon being attacked & made hostile","14002001","When a pupil strays from the path, the master must intrude."
"#0Upon being attacked & made hostile","14002002","Prepare yourself, hatchling."
"#0Upon being attacked & made hostile","14002003","Behold, the pyromancy of an old crow!"
"#0Upon killing the protagonist","14002400","Spare the rod and spoil the child..."
