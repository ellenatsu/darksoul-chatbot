"#0Talk-1st time","10000000","Well, a newcomer I see."
"#0Talk-1st time","10000001","I am Andre. I serve at this shrine."
"#0Talk-1st time","10000002","As a humble smith, forging weapons."
"#0Talk-1st time","10000003","You're in search of the Lords of Cinder, I trust?"
"#0Talk-1st time","10000004","A toilsome journey I'd wager. You'll require good arms."
"#0Talk-1st time","10000005","Let me smith y' weapons."
"#0Talk-1st time","10000006","I am a smith, such is my purpose."
"#0Talk-2nd time","10000100","Ahh, well met."
"#0Talk-2nd time","10000101","Tis good to see y' in good health."
"#0Talk-2nd time","10000102","What needs smithing this day?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000400","Weapons and protection are sturdy enough, by and large."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000401","But when overused, they'll eventually break."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000402","When their durability is low, repair becomes a necessity."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000403","Use a powder, or simply rest at a bonfire."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000404","But should chance impel them break,
bring them me."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000405","I'll hammer 'em back into shape."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000406","They take no pleasure in breaking, I assure y'."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 1st time","10000407","So, handle them with care, if y' would."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000500","There are two ways to smith weapons."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000501","Simple reinforcement is one, and infusion the other."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000502","Reinforcement is straight forward.
It strengthens a weapon without altering its property."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000503","Infusion is a more advanced form
of smithing that infuses an element."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000504","Reinforcement requires titanite,
and infusion requires gems."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000505","Bring the stones, and I'll do the smithing."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000506","It's m' purpose, after all!"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 2nd time","10000507","In battle, y' weapons are yer only friends.
 Forge them well, and they won't let y' down."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000600","Ahh, another matter."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000601","Infusing weapons with gems requires a special kind of coal."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000602","My humble coals won't be any use infusing more unusual gems."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000603","I know, it's an awful shame, but it's all I have."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000604","Oh, please, don't give me that look."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000605","Believe it or not, I'm quite thin-skinned."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 3rd time","10000606","..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001400","Oh, by the by."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001401","If you find any Estus Shards,
bring 'em 'ere."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001402","They can be used to reinforce either of y' Estus Flasks."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001403","Without those flasks, you'd want for life or focus."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001404","And they'll always stay with y'. Why not treat 'em well?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Talk"" 4th time","10001405","..."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001000","Oh, you've returned. I was hoping to see y'."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001001","That crestfallen arse Hawkwood, he handed me this."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001002","He's changed a great deal since he left this place."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001003","Graven of face, he asked me to give it y'."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001004","Well, now that that task is concluded..."
"#0Talk-After protagonist has obtained the Dragon Torso Stone","10001005","What would y' ha' me smith today?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Farron Coal""","10000700","Oh, my...this coal is from the Undead Legion..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Farron Coal""","10000701","Used to forge the weapons of Farron's Abyss Watchers."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Farron Coal""","10000702","A fine prize. I'm honoured to be endued with it."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Farron Coal""","10000703","Now I'll be equipped to infuse special gems."

"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001500","Well, well... What's the Undead Legion
doing with a coal such as this?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001501","I'd heard one of the Crystal Sages
had sided with Farron's Abyss Watchers."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001502","I suppose it must be true."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001503","You should know, this coal is imbued with magic.
First one I've ever seen."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001504","Hardly a surprise is it? I've never been one for books or wise men."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Sage's Coal""","10001505","..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000800","My, my... The coal of that peaceable giant."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000801","Seems like ages past. I imagine his passing was long ago."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000802","I miss the old bugger, I do."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000803","My thanks. I'll be sure this coal is put to good use."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000804","I'll be smithing weapons never afore seen by the likes of y'!"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000805","It's but a small service, to pay my humble respects."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Giant's Coal""","10000806","..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000900","Lords... Where didye hap'n upon this coal?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000901","This is much too dark. I see the Abyss in it..."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000902","Yet, a smith I remain. I won't turn down a request."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000903","But forget not,"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000904","Your fight is for the flame, and for y' fellow kin. Just like mine."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Give Coal"" & choose ""Give Profaned Coal""","10000905","A cursed fate this may be,
but hope remains, does it not?"
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave","10000300","Prithee, be careful."
"#0Menu-Choose ""Leave"", or abruptly leave","10000301","I don't want to see m' work squandered!"
