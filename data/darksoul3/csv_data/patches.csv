I can't remember my real name, so let's just go with that."

"#0Talk-2nd time","73000100","Ohh, in all honesty there's something I should tell you..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73000101","I'm...a Hollow.
Yes, I try to play it off, but I haven't a clue about my past."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73000102","Who I was, or what I lived for.
Not even my own blessed name."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73000103","That's why I've come here, searching."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73000104","For the Purging Monument, said to be in the Ringed City,"

aren't doing much to help me remember anymore..."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73000106","..."
"#0Talk-3rd time","73000200","Well, that's the long and short of it."
"#0Talk-3rd time","73000201","So, if I completely forget who you are, don't be wrath with me."

I should stay quiet."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000402","Wait, I'll make it up to you, by letting you in on a secret of sorts."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000403","Past here, you'll find the remains of a giant earthen tower
half-submerged in a poisonous swamp."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000404","Not a very nice place to visit...
Only, there's precious treasure in the thick of the swamp."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000405","I didn't have any use for it, you see.
So sorry, I left the whole package behind."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000406","If I get the chance, I could go fetch it for you,
but if that's too long to wait, go nab it for yourself."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000407","...I know who you are.
A righteous warrior, yes? With a solemn duty, to boot."
"#0Talk-2nd time at his 2nd location","73000408","Well, grab that treasure, that's as good a duty as any."

To the greatest warrior there is."

"#0Talk-After entering the Ringed City without retrieving the Titanite Slab","73000703","Oh, it was only a hop and a skip.
I needed a rest from old nan over there."
"#0Talk-After entering the Ringed City without retrieving the Titanite Slab","73000704","Here, go ahead, it's yours.
Maybe it'll help you with that solemn duty of yours."
"#0Talk-After entering the Ringed City without retrieving the Titanite Slab","73000705","..."

"#0Talk-1st time","73000901","A true blessing, that we should seek the same place,
and find ourselves standing here, together."
"#0Talk-1st time","73000902","I've got the last of my brew. Let's have our own little toast with it."
"#0Talk-1st time","73000903","To my search, and to your duty. And to the joy that lies before us."

"#0Talk-2nd time","73001003","And... What terrible grudges I held."
"#0Talk-2nd time","73001004","...I dunno, I just have this feeling.
That that's the kind of man I was."
